7. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers**  
   * Responsible for identifying bugs and ensuring the product meets quality standards through manual and automated testing processes.

8. **Test Automation Engineers**  
   * Specialized QA engineers who develop and maintain automated test scripts to ensure efficient, repeatable testing across builds.

9. **DevOps Engineer**  
   * Manages infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and system monitoring. Ensures seamless integration and delivery of code through CI/CD and maintains system reliability in production.

10. **Backend Developer**  
    * Focuses on server-side logic, database interactions, and integration of APIs. Ensures that the application performs well under load and handles data securely.

11. **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
    * Manages and maintains the database systems. Ensures data integrity, optimal performance, backups, and security of the project’s data.
   
## Database Design Overview
The database is designed to efficiently support the core features of the application, including user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

#### Key Entities and Fields

1. **Users**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`
   - `role` (e.g., guest, host, admin)

2. **Properties**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `location`
   - `price_per_night`

3. **Bookings**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
   - `check_in_date`
   - `check_out_date`
   - `status` (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

4. **Reviews**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
   - `rating` (e.g., 1–5)
   - `comment`

5. **Payments**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)
   - `amount`
   - `payment_method` (e.g., card, mobile money)
   - `payment_status` (e.g., successful, failed)

#### Relationships

- A **User** can create multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** on different **Properties**.
- A **Review** is always associated with a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.

This schema supports scalability, integrity, and efficient querying of user and transactional data.
